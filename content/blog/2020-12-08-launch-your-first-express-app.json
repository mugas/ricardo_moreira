In fact, when I decided to learn to code 2 years ago, the first course I took was a full stack [one](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/),  where I did an app with node and express, but after that I decided to focus more on front-end and never went to that avenue anymore. \n\nNowadays I decided that I want to write more and expand my knowledge so I decided to start writing about new topics or old, but more recurrent. So my first one is going to be about [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).\n\nSo simply express.js is a framework for Node.js. So like in JS you can build a app/webpage with React, Vue, Angular, many others, for the back-end there are also frameworks to work with Node and one of them is express.  I haven't had worked with others, but there is plenty more that you can try (and me also).\n\nWhat about PUG? \n\nThat was a first for me. I saw it many people using in some projects ( Code Pen is full of them), I knew that was a html processor but not much more.\n\n[Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) is a template engine. In other words makes you write HTML easier and when using dianmyc data is also more user friendly. That means of course that now you have to learn PUG to save time while writing HTML...\n\nI read that when using express, if you create the *express generator* tool, a tool that creates the skeleton of an express app, it comes with jade/pug template already installed so I decided that I wanted to give it a go.\n\nWe are not going to use express generator here.\n\n\n\nSo what we going to build/do? I wanted to create a simple project, but because I am a visual person I needed to see it live. We going to build a simple"
