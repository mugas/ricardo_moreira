I set one day per week to prepare for the newsletter. Of course that every day I have to do something about it like:

* Do the interview
* Check new possible people to interview
* check new sources

But the assembling and preparing are done in one day. And during the week I always got some more ideas that I need to improve or want to implement.

One of them is the interviews. Even that I was happy of being creating them, the one with [Xavi](https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti), I decided to create a template in Canva and although I liked it I thought that was a too big template for the newsletter and was not good for accessibility.

So in the week's interview with [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexstyl), I wanted to make something new and different. Things I wanted to achieve

* Fast solution
* Everyone could access the interviews easily
* Indexed searchable
* Better for accessibility

After a lot of thought, AGAIN Notion came to the rescue. In less than 10 minutes I created [this ](https://mugascodes.notion.site/49fa3c1a135948a79a0028fb4b979979?v=251f256e455246128d07f03f47ce7078)small template. Now all my interviews will look the same and look clean and good ( in my opinion at least)

This week was dedicated to creating a questionnaire for people that are building digital products.

For me to create a better [product ](https://bizbox.club/)I need to know more about who is building products also.

Also, I believe that is a good instrument and data to know more about indie hackers. I decided not to reinvent the wheel here and went to Google form and create [this ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefi5o_k3DyQ3pLp8D4Sy5RQu2bexL8mTd2cZ90TVaWsdCOxA/viewform)form there.

Feel free to participate and share if you know anyone building any product or had built in the past.

This following week is all about templates. I am pretty sure I can't finish it only this week as I decided to make templates in Notion, but also some in Excel and Canva but more on that next week.
