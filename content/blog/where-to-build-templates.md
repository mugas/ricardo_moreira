title: Where to build templates?
summary: After I started making a small list of what templates I wanted to
  build, ideas start flowing and now there will be 3 different places where I
  will build the templates. Bitting more than I can chew?

The idea was simple: BizBox should have templates to any user to use. They should be edit on the dashboard itself or if not possible, able to dowloaded into the pc and the user edit it and then saved, printed or whatever he need.



I tought that maybe 5 templates will be enough:

* Email templates
* Sales Invoice
* Some marketing related
* Calendar
* And something related to social

The challenged started when I went more deep with that, ideas start flowing and more templates were added to the list and more and more. Now I have around 20 templates to be created that go from sales, marketing, management, productivity and social.



By adding that many I also realized that I couldn't do all of them in Notion. Why?

As much as I love Notion
