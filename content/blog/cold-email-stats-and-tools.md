Before we go deep on what are the best tools to use for cold email, I put some stats about the art of cold emailing

![Cold email stats](https://res.cloudinary.com/mugas/image/upload/v1643837883/Statistics_Twitter_wi8hnf.png "Cold email stats")



Yes, it's true, only on average, 1% of emails have a response. So In 100 emails, one will answer, and in 1000 only 10. So basically is a question of numbers.

Of course that that 1% changes from business to business where some businesses can reach even 20%.

So don't feel discouraged and keep pushing it

One great way to push it is to have the best tools for it.
