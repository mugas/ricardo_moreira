If you have a business, you know that having a presence online is important but that is not enough tough and there is where SEO comes in place. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and stands for the process of enhancing the quality and the number of people that go to your website.

What about Local SEO? 

Local Seo is not used for every business but should be mandatory for a brick-and-mortar business or even an online business that works mostly or also locally.

So if you have a bakery in Kuopio, Finland, there is no point in you set your website for the SEO to be improved to perform searches for Helsinki for example.

Even if you have a web development services in Evora, Portugal that works online it is worth optimizing your business also to perform well for searches related to “web development services in Evora”.



The same goes for the other way around. If your business is totally global or doesn’t require any local connection, then local SEO is not for your company.

With local SEO you increase the visibility of your business in your own community.



**How does it work?**



Every time you do any search in Google, it checks all over the internet and starts creating indexes using “spiders” and then checks the content of that page, indexes, and moves on to the next page.



If you do a normal search on the web now, Google or the search engine you use will give you the results that are near you. So if you search for a plumber, it will give you results near the location where you are.

If you do the same search some km away, you might get a different answer( depending on how big your city is). That is Local Seo.

How important local SEO it is?



There are many explanations why local SEO is important, but I will focus only on this stat:

76% of consumers that search for something local on their phone visit a store that day

Therefore if you can put your business in front of that search, you have a great chance that you will have more customers going to you.

Now that we saw what is local Seo, how can I improve it on my website and company?

In the next post, I will talk about the most important approaches that you can use to start improving local Seo
