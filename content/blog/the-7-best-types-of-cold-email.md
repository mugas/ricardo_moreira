Now that we know what a cold email is and why we should use it, the next step is to go through different types of cold emails

**AIDA**



One of the most known ways to write a cold email is to use **AIDA** which stands for Attention - Interested - Desire - Action.



In the first paragraph, you grab their **attention**, then explain why your offer will **interest** your prospect. Say something that grabs their **desire** about your offer. And ask them to take **action.**



Here is an example from [Ezanga](https://www.ezanga.com/blog/how-to-write-stronger-email-content-using-the-aida-model):

**Sujan 3 sentence format**



A simple but practical way. In 3 sentences( can be more the idea is to be short) give a short introduction, a description of what you are asking, and your ask.



Seems so simple that is difficult right? But practice makes perfect and the more you know your product, the better you can describe it in a way that a customer wants it.

An example you say? Mailshake has many [here](https://mailshake.com/blog/cold-email-templates/#sentence).

**BAB**



Before After Bridge. This is the typical method where you show what is the life of the customer **before** your solution and then what would be their life **after** using your solution. The **bridge** stands for how you take your future customer from point A to point B.



See [this ](https://blog.klenty.com/bab-technique-to-write-cold-emails/)example here:

**PAS**



Problem Agitate Solve. In this one, your main focus is the **problem** that your prospect is facing. Then you have to **agitate** that problem, emphasize it, show how big it is or it can become. Then **solve** it with your solution.

**PPP**



Praise Picture Push. This can be used after some research or you discover that your future customer or prospect, achieve something or reach some milestone. So you start by **praising** that. After you **picture-perfect** how your solution can push even forward that milestone. Finally, you **push** it to take action now.

Take this [example ](https://www.growthrhino.com/cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads)as a guide:

**Competitor Product**



If you know that your prospect uses a product that is your competitor, one idea is to send an email and mention that and ask how they are doing with it, if they are happy with it.

Then mention that you would love to join on a call to explain why your product is different ( for better).



Here is an [example](https://www.closeriq.com/blog/2016/10/cold-email-templates/):

**Free Value**



This one is great but for sure you don’t get the sale on the first email. This one is where you can start reaching out and creating a relationship with your prospect. How?

Sending them an email offering them some template you did or even an article that you found online that you thought would be interesting to them

There are many others types and templates that you can use. Even if you go through these ones, be sure to adapt to your reality, to your product and service.
