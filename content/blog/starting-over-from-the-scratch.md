Some time has passed since I wrote here last time. Not many time has passed since I tried to write here.

The thing is that or I end up, justifying myself by saying that I didn't had time or I end up with so many topics that I want to write and I end up writting about none. Luckilly I decide to give indiehackers a chance and build in Public and went for win.

Let's go back, where was I before all that?

2019 and all seemed going on the right direction:

*  Just got married ; 
* Was learning more about web development
* Got a nice job, not yer code related but that would allow me to control better my time and the time with my family
* New daughter on the way

I was a man with a plan. Steady working hours I could dedicate to code in a more focused way. Tried the 4.30 waking up approach, start running and it was some of the best decisions I took speacilly when it comes to health and productivity

I wanted to find a job in coding, but that voice in your head ( you know the one that is almost always right?) was always pushing for me start doing courses online or some website service or some entrepreneuerial side gig that both the back of my brain and the rest know that I love. 

I was a co partner in 2 companies I found my one company once, all in different countries and all failed and succed in some way, but I never professionally felt so alive and I learn a lot with my mistakes but also with my wins. Besides that I was part of start up programs and my educational background is also business so it was and it is something that passions me about.



So the man with a plan had doubts, but I continued with a plan that were 2 actually.

Then corona hit and my life changed, even that I tought that would not. In fact after I get laid off I tought "ok more time to learn code and find a job then", but my brain had other plans.

So yes I got laid off and end up in that situation for a year and one month basically.

In the beggining I end up with not much time for coding anymore because I was home but so were my kids so still was coding in early morning like before. 

Time was passing and I was feeling that I was going in a ruth, not been able to code or focus to it as much as I could, called to work for a day or so with a day of notice, making me always near the phone waiting for the call. I start to feel more anxious and powerless.  

During that time I end up tooking a program to build startup and I felt alive again. The ideas still didn't see the day of light( This [one](https://www.instagram.com/goodstuffoods/) had some trials and will come out in a digital way but not for now)  and probably they will see it in a different way that was presented in that program.

After that program the flame inside was again light up but not for long. The fact that I was in laid off and money start to become short and never was in that position in my life before was starting to mess with my head.

I couldn't start a new company as I would lose all unemployment benefits and as much I like the Tony Robbins "[burn the boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psGNdh7UPB4)" approach, I am not alone in the Island and I didn't had any safety net. And my wife and daugthers are always first.

I was called sometimes for my job but when it came the second wave on begginig of this year, all went loose again.

In all these times I was continuing search for jobs, entry level for coding, SEO, hospitality ( with corona right) , business developer, but no luck.

After January, we knew that financailly we could become more tight after July so I start seeing the opposite of the light at the end of the tunnel, I was seeing darkness all over.

In the meanwhile my most clear and fast idea to have a company was [Good Stuff Creations](gscreations.io). I am doing it has freelance mode as it was the only way to not loose the benefits as i was laid off. It will start as a company as late of November this year.

Before I decided to any customer was a good customer ( no niche) so i was fishing with a hammer.

Only  in the last months I niched down and felt good about that decision. The thing was this was still not bringing money to the table and that was leaving me not happy.

So I decided to apply to more jobs, any job. Over my qualifications, under my qualifications, for the same qualifications. Any type you think I applied. I even end up to google maps search companies and did open applications. Nothing

I send over than 300 open applications and jobs adds and nothing.

Finally In May I decided to go back where I left in 2019. Not full time but it's something and more than anything I can focus in other things. 

So I end up thinking what I really want and love? What I want to do when I grow up? I discover that most of all I don't want to depend on anyone anymore at the end of the month if I have money or not. And to do that I have to work and do in what makes me happy and in what I am good at- turning ideas into reality, building new stuff all the time.

Great part of my working life has been in hospitality and I loved it; when I rediscover coding I also loved it, but more than loved it I discover that constant learning is the solution and coding gave me that. Because I consider myself a creative person I have many ideas but always seemed wierd to put them as a business, because they were my ideas.

Indie hackers as been a place where I go a lot to read about growing a business, building in public has been also a hastag that I've been following in Twitter.

After reading more about that, after have been more focused I decided that I will start building projects/products online and sell them.

Good Stuff Foods I changed the idea to become a digital food product, but only can be done after I can work full time for myself, hence the stop for now.

Good Stuff Creations would focused on local producers that I respect and want to help to put their products out

I also wanted something that challenged everyday so
