Finally, the first issue is out of the BizBox newsletter.

Was supposed to be out last Monday, but took more time than normal for my account to be activated in [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) so only yesterday was ok to go.

So, In the beginning, I thought to wait for next Monday to launch it but I decided to put the first issue out already.

Next Monday I will talk more about the process of all the creation of the newsletter, programs, and tools used, etc. For now, I want to talk about it the why.

Newsletters always were a topic I wanted to go deeper into, so when I decided that the first product to launch be [Bizbox](https://bizbox.club/) I knew that I had to launch a newsletter. Because the point of the product is that help who wants to run a business or is running a business on its own and time is of the essence, therefore having a product where much of the info they need is only one place is a must, and having a newsletter with weekly updates is completely necessary

The first issue is here, still with many flaws and much to improve. 

If I would be waiting for it to be perfect the way I wanted I would never release it so that is the main lesson here. One of the things I like in building in public is learning and reiterating while you keep launching and pushing.

Two big points that I want to improve on the newsletter is

1. Better sources of info and more tailored for the audience ( solopreneurs, content creators, Shopify owners)
2. Small interviews with someone from that audience explaining part of their process

The first point is in the works and will continue being forever; the second one I hope that in the next issue (25.10.2021) I have some interviews already to show.

Any questions, doubts, reviews, and comments are more than welcome.
