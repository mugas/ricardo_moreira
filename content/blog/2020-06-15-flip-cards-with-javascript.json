  "body": "Flipping a card, or some element is something that is used quiet often in many projects/applications. \n\nYou can achieve it \"only\" using it CSS, by toggle and even by click, but it is a good way to start learning JS. It takes only few lines of code of Javascript and with some css you can make a nice effect to your page.\n\nIn this project we are going to use 4 different cards and loop over them to know how to achieve the flipping of every one of them. Also I had some responsiveness and accessibility to the page. Like we did it with the [Image Gallery](https://www.ricardomoreira.io/blog/2020-05-28-create-a-image-gallery) we also going to build it mobile first.\n\n\nSo what we are going to build? A page with music albums covers and when flipping we can access the back of the cards where is the info about the album. You can see the final project from the following links.\n\n## Links\n\n* [Project page](https://goodstuffoodsgallery.netlify.app/)\n* [GitHub page](https://github.com/mugas/Image-Gallery)\n* [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/mugas/pen/gOaJeMm)\n* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URXj6jZeCz0)\n* You also can read it [here](<>), [here](<>) and [here](<>)\n\nSo first let's build our html.\n\n```html\n<header><h1 tabindex=\"0\" id=\"title\">New Albums this week</h1></header>\r\n\r\n    <section class=\"cards\">\r\n      <div class=\"cards__single\">\r\n        <div class=\"cards__front\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"cards__back\">\r\n        </div>\r\n\n       <div class=\"cards__single\">\r\n         <div class=\"cards__front\">\r\n         </div>\r\n         <div class=\"cards__back\">\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"cards__single\">\r\n        <div class=\"cards__front\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"cards__back\">\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"cards__single\">\r\n        <div class=\"cards__front\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"cards__back\">\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\n```\n\nSo what we have here? Let's start with our header. I set a `tabindex=0`on it to receive keyboard focus. When a user wants to \"scroll\" a website with the tab button, only forms and links receive programmatic focus. With the **tab index equals to 0** you ensure that other elements will get the focus, but will not change the tab order, so it will run trough the logical navigation flow.\nThen we create a section with the class `cards` and inside of it a div that will represent one card `class=\"cards__single\"`and then inside of that div we will add the front and the back of the card. Each one of them will be inside of each div with their own class `cards__front` `cards__back`. Then we just do exactly the same for 3 more cards, because we will build 4 in total.\n\nNow we only need to add our data. I just picked up some unsplash pics from albums and then search the album info. So one card will look like this:\n\n```html\n<header><h1 tabindex=\"0\" id=\"title\">New Albums this week</h1></header>\r\n\r\n    <section class=\"cards\">\r\n      <div class=\"cards__single\">\r\n        <div class=\"cards__front\">\r\n          <img\r\n            class=\"cards__image\"\r\n            src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514924527133-371124f6f5e3?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=667&q=80\"\r\n            alt=\"Bon Iver album\"\r\n          />\r\n          <h1 class=\"cards__artist\" tabindex=\"0\">Bon Iver</h1>\r\n          <p class=\"cards__album\" tabindex=\"0\">\r\n            <strong>For Emma, Forever Ago</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"cards__back\">\r\n          <h2 tabindex=\"0\">Songs</h2>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>Flume</li>\r\n            <li>Lump Sum</li>\r\n            <li>Skinny Love</li>\r\n            <li>The Wolves</li>\r\n            <li>Blind Sided</li>\r\n            <li>Creature Fear</li>\r\n            <li>Team</li>\r\n            <li>For Emma</li>\r\n            <li>re:Stacks</li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p class=\"cards__year\">Year: 2008</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\n\nI only add one album  info here. Below there is the code pen:\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"dark\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"mugas\" data-slug-hash=\"zYrBXeo\" style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Albums - No CSS\">\r\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/mugas/pen/zYrBXeo\">\r\n  Albums - No CSS</a> by Ricardo (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/mugas\">@mugas</a>)\r\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nNow the data is there, let's try to put the cards in order and the back hidden( some styling like the title will not be mentioned here, but will be present in the code pen and final version)\nFirst we flex:\n\n```css\n.cards {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-content: center;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n}\n```\n\nWe are building first for mobile, so in the phone we want that the cards will be one after the other when you scroll down, hence we put the `flex-direction:column`and `justify-content:center`.\nNow let's style each one of the cards:\n\n```css\n.cards__single {\r\n  background: #a64e43;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  margin-top: 20px;\r\n  border-radius: 16px;\r\n  box-shadow: 0 5px 18px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cards__image {\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  border-radius: 16px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cards__artist,\r\n.cards__album {\r\n  color: #20263f;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cards__front img {\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  height: 250px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cards__album {\r\n  font-style: italic;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\nli {\r\n  line-height: 21px;\r\n}\n```\n\nThe more important to mention here is we add to each card also flex and also `flex-direction: column` for the same reason: We want that the data is one after the other. For example, first the image, then the title and also the songs of each album one after the other. Also to mention that this we don't need to change mobile to desktop because we want same direction either way.\nBesides that the rest is, adding color and some spacing. It still can be improved this area, either for mobile and desktop so you can change the way you feel like it.\nHere is the code pen:\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"dark\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"mugas\" data-slug-hash=\"yLebaeX\" style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Flip Cards  - With flex\">\r\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/mugas/pen/yLebaeX\">\r\n  Flip Cards  - With flex</a> by Ricardo (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/mugas\">@mugas</a>)\r\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nNow that it starts to look like something, let's hide the back of the card and style the rest:\n\n```css\n.cards__front,\r\n.cards__back {\r\n  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\r\n  backface-visibility: hidden;\r\n}\r\n.cards__front {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  transform: rotateX(0deg);\r\n  -webkit-transform: rotateX(0deg);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cards__back {\r\n  transform: rotateY(180deg);\r\n  -webkit-transform: rotateY(180deg);\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  top: 10px;\r\n  color: #20263f;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
