# Description

When I decided to build my website, I was starting to learn [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) so I decided to give it a go.

Was not easy in the beginning, couldn't find any good documents or templates that would make it work with Nuxt and Netlify. I used [Bael Template](https://github.com/jake-101/bael-template) and [Tyler Template](https://github.com/tylermercer/nuxt-netlifycms-boilerplate) as reference and went from there.

From that, I used also the Nellify forms to create my contact page, add my projects and blog page and other features.

There is still many features to add, bugs to fix and improvements to make. I will update here as long as I go.

The more I will learn, more updates will show up here, among other projects.

Stick around
