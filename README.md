# Description

I wanted to have a website where I could offer my freelance services but also could share my coding tutorials, snippets, etc. I had my own [website](http://ricardomoreira.io/) but I want that my personal website becomes more than only about coding, hence I create this website.
Also made in Nuxt, but with some improvements. Mostly based on Tom [tutorial](https://code-tribe.com/). Then I add change (and will continue changing it) to become more my own website. With Tom tutorial I could learn more about to create a blog without using Vuex, but stil have a fast and functional website.
